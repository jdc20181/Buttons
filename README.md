# Buttons
Some Easy Examples of buttons - 

#Setting Up 

To start off with you need to know the basics of CSS and HTML, without those, this is useless. 

Next- We will work with both `<a>` Buttons and `<button>` buttons  using a class we can use a regular Hyperlink to create a button. 

All the classes are really basic - in general - buttons don't need a lot of effort to create. Even with fancy buttons such as raised backgrounds or shadows. 

#Using the code

All the buttons are divided into two class files in each type - I am sure after a while there will be a lot. 

To use the code, just pick whichever you want to use - picking a which type to use will depend on it's function - for menus, buttons that need a link - such as download buttons use the `link.css` - it targets the `<a>` element. For all other needs using the `<button>` tag - you can use the `button` class as it is in the `button.css` file.
